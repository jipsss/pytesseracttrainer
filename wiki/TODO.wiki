  * *localisation*
  * *configuration* (menu and user file) for:
   # last used directory
   # last open files
   # custom font
   # localisation
   # themes/layout (see screenshot in [http://code.google.com/p/pytesseracttrainer/issues/detail?id=1 issue 1] as proposal)
  * *multipage tiff support* (maybe it is not good idea open 200 pages tiff ;-) but maybe this can be done via '*project file*' and after adjusting all pages produce finale tiff and box file)
  * *diff against external text file* with visualization of differences in pyTesseractTrainer. For training process it common there is also available source text for training images. This feature would increase significantly productivity if somebody would start to train images and text files from [http://www.pgdp.net/c/ Distributed Proofreaders]
